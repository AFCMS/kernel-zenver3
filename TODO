# Put stuff likely to go upstream (in decreasing likelyhood) at the top.

* linux-2.6-compile-fixes.patch
	Empty

* linux-2.6-debug-taint-vm.patch
	(on its way upstream, should be there for 3.2)

* linux-2.6-acpi-video-dos.patch
* linux-2.6-defaults-acpi-video.patch
* linux-2.6-defaults-aspm.patch
disable-i8042-check-on-apple-mac.patch

* linux-2.6-silence-acpi-blacklist.patch
* linux-2.6-silence-fbcon-logo.patch

* linux-2.6-acpi-debug-infinite-loop.patch
  Responsible: mjg59

* fix_xen_guest_on_old_EC2.patch
  Ugly for upstream. It's a hack to make old HV's work optimally.
  Eventually we can drop it, but probably not until fixed HV's
  are commonplace. (When?)
  Responsible: Justin.

* add-appleir-usb-driver.patch
  Added September 2009, but had been around even before that. Wtf ?
  Responsible: Bastien

* dmar-disable-when-ricoh-multifunction.patch
  Added Octoboer 2010

* drm-intel-make-lvds-work.patch
  Around since forever. Wtf ?

* linux-2.6-intel-iommu-igfx.patch
  Invert igfx_off/igfx_on option. Around since forever. Upstreamable ?
  Mustard ? Config option ?

*************************************************************************

'MUSTARD' patches.  Fedora local patches that are very unlikely to go upstream.

* linux-2.6-32bit-mmap-exec-randomization.patch
  One half of the remaining exec-shield diff.
  davej bugged Ingo again on Jun 17 2011 about upstreaming.

* linux-2.6-i386-nx-emulation.patch
  The ugly segment hack part of exec-shield that Linus hates.
  Unlikely to ever go upstream.

* linux-2.6-crash-driver.patch
	Unlikely to go upstream.
	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=492803

* linux-2.6-e1000-ich9-montevina.patch
  Intel hates it. Davej has an SDV that needs it.
  Low maintenence, and worth hanging onto until it gets replaced
  with something that fails in a different way.
